          <p class="Quiz-info">After clicking the start quiz button, you will have 60 seconds to complete this quiz over fundamentals in JS.
             There will be 5 questions, each with 4 possible answers.
             Once you select an answer you will be moved to the next question and told if you were correct or incorrect below the next question.
             If the answer you chose was incorrect, 10 seconds will be deducted from the timer.
             Your final score will be the sum of the number of questions you got correct multiplied by 10 and the remaining time left in your quiz when completed. Good luck!
